# Rocket-Apogee-with-ML
 This script simulates rocket launches based on parameters like mass, thrust, drag coefficient, wind speed, and temperature. It generates data,trains a Random Forest Classifier for success prediction and a Random Forest Regressor for maximum altitude.The models are evaluated,saved,and can predict success and altitude for new rocket configurations.
